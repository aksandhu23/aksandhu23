<h1 align="center">Hey there, my name is Amrit Sandhu!</h1>

### What am I up to? 
I have recently completed a Master of Environmental Data Science degree at the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management in California. For my Master's Capstone project, we aimed to analyze emissions intensity of electrified steel production in the United States at the individual plant level and the repo can be accessed [here](https://github.com/steeltracker/carbon-analysis).

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love puzzles and solving complex problems which has led me into the field of data science.
